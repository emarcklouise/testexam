NOTICE:

	PART 1 - I can't access the url provided. There is an issue at my local environment.
	PART 2 - I can't manage to create an API. So instead, I created a PHP Server Request that will server as my API. The logic is the same. I just make a work around.
	PART 3 - Almost same on part 2. But the additional condition which is an API is giving me an error locally.

	Kindly read my comment at my inline code. I did my best to present this as logically the same with your question. Thank you for the opportunity.
